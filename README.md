# pitch_shifter

A very simple pitch shifter vst.

It doesn't sound very good, but it does manage to pitch audio in realtime. There's a nasty artifact sound because i'm using a very stupid algorithm that just came to me in a dream.

If you mix it in with the dry signal, you can mask the artifacts somewhat and make it sound ok.
